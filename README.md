This repository contains all of the research materials, data, and data analysis code for my dissertation project, titled "Gradient Categorization, Linguistic Diversity, and Second Language Acquisition: Perceptual Learning of L2 Phonemic Contrasts Using a Multilingual Training Paradigm".

In this research project, I investigated the relationship between gradient categorization, linguistic diversity, and L2 speech category learning across three studies using a VAS (visual analog scale) perceptual speech rating task, AX perceptual speech discrimination task, a MCPD (multiple-choice partial dictation) listening assessment task, and a Linguistic Diversity Questionnaire (LDQ). The target L2 speech categories in this project were Japanese vowel length and consonant length.


The top level folders in the repository are as follows:

B. Task Materials
C. Study 1 Data and Analysis
D. Study 2 Data and Analysis
E. Study 3 Data and Analysis
F. Research Notes

A more thorough description of the subdirectories and supplementary materials files will be coming soon.
